Projects
Bangla Sentence Punctuation Restoration [GitHub]
A transformer-based Bangla model was used to build the sentence punctuation model. Llama 3.2 was
also used to infer with non-punctuation sentence correction. FastAPI was used to prepare the API for
deployment with Docker.
Tech Stack: BanglaBERT, LLM, Llama 3.2, FastAPI
Chat Bot using LLM with Gradio [GitHub]
The chatbot is built with Flask for the backend and uses a pre-trained model from Hugging Face for
generating responses.
Tech Stack: LLM, Gen AI, Flask, Hugging Face
Chattogram language to standard bangla language conversion [GitHub]
Developed a transformer-based Seq2Seq model to convert local Chattogram language to standard
Bangla. The data was processed by the sentencepice tokenizer.
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, Seq2Seq
Automatic Wrong Side Vehicle Detection System [GitHub]
Developed a YOLO v10-based wrong-side vehicle movement detection. The wrong side vehicle was
detected using a custom-trained YOLO v10 model and the license plate number was extracted using
EasyOCR.
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, YOLOv10, EasyOCR
Named Entity Recognition using SpaCy transformers [GitHub]
Developedatransformer-basedNERmodeltoextracttheentityofadocument. Themodelwastrained
on the resume dataset.
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Transformers, RoBERTa
Image Cryptography with Autoencoders [GitHub]
Imageencryptionanddecryptionusingachaoticmapsequenceandanautoencoder. Itincludescodefor
generating chaotic map sequences, shuffling and deshuffling images, preparing datasets, and computing
performance metrics .
Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, CNN, Security
Bangla Roberta Question and Answer [GitHub]
Bangla Question Answering model architecture is the BERT-based Roberta Model, which is trained on
Bangla QA data. For training this model, the Bangla QA data is converted into the SQuAD v2 format.
Tech Stack: Python, PyTorch, Transformer
Predicting Telco Customer Chrun using Machine Learning [GitHub]
Customer churn, which refers to customers ceasing their relationship with a company, is a significant
metric that companies track to understand their service performance.
Tech Stack: Python, EDA, Scikit-learn
