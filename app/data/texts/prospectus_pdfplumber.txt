Personal Projects 1. Pneumonia Detection Web App with Deployment on HF Spaces (GitHub)
Utilized transfer learning model VGG19 to classify chest X-ray images for
pneumonia detection. And then developed a user-friendly web application
using Gradio for easy accessibility and deployment.
2. LLM based Text Summarizer Web App (GitHub)
Developed a web application that uses the LaMini-Flan-T5-248M Transformer
model for text summarization. The app condenses large pieces of text into
concise summaries, improving information processing.
3. Search and Query Across Multiple PDFs using LLM(GitHub)
Developed an AI-powered web application that allows users to upload
multiple PDFs and query them using natural language. Utilized Google’s
Gemini model and LangChain for conversational AI, and PyPDF2 for text
extraction. Integrated FAISS for fast vector-based search.
4. RAG-Based Physician Directory Search Web App (GitHub)
Developed a web application leveraging the Gemini-1.5-Pro model and RAG
architecture for querying a physician directory. The app retrieves and generates
precise answers based on a provided PDF, ensuring context-aware responses
and enhancing data accessibility.
5. Face Mask Detection Based Door Lock System (GitHub)
Implemented a CNN model to detect mask-wearing individuals and control
door access based on detection results.
